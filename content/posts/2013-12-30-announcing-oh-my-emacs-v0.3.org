Today I'm happy to announce
[[https://github.com/xiaohanyu/oh-my-emacs][oh-my-emacs]] v0.3.

It has been three months since I first released oh-my-emacs from my
homebrew messy dotemacs project to public. To my suprise, oh-my-emacs
has attracted many interests from all over the world.

The v0.3 version of oh-my-emacs contains various improvements, check its
[[https://github.com/xiaohanyu/oh-my-emacs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.org#v03][CHANGELOG]]
for a condensed feature list.

Several features worth mentioning (v0.1->v0.3):

-  code refactoring:

   -  Oh-my-emacs splits all its modules into two levels: =core= and
      =modules=. Files in =core= are required by default, while files in
      =modules= are optional. You can load necessary module when you
      really need it.

-  ome-org module:

   -  Upgrade =org-mode= to latest 8.x branch. This brings us a more
      powerful export engine.

-  ome-cc module:

   -  Oh-my-emacs support auto-complete for C/C++ macros! Combined with
      =pkg-config=, oh-my-emacs cc module can be used as a perfect C/C++
      working environment with perfect semantic completion for functions
      and macros for any installed libs recognizable by =pkg-config=.

-  ome-java module:

   -  Oh-my-emacs provide semantic completion for Java projects via
      emacs-eclim. Though not perfect(and a little heavy), this is a
      workable solution now.

-  ome-lisp module:

   -  The original ubiquitous ome-lisp module has been split to four
      modules:

      -  ome-emacs-lisp module
      -  ome-common-lisp module
      -  ome-clojure module
      -  ome-scheme module

-  documentation:

   -  Add a table to specify the system requirments and el-get packages.
      Thus you can install necessary system tools to make oh-my-emacs
      modules work as expected.

-  compatibility:

   -  Improve compatibility for Mac OS X.

-  completion:

   -  Add semantic completion for scheme (via =ac-geiser=)
   -  Add completion table to show you the currrent semantic completion
      support for various programming languages.

-  miscs:

   -  Basic support for JavaScript, Ruby, OCaml.
   -  Move some unstale packages to ome-experimental module, load as you
      need.

Five months of spare time work, 200 git commits, 120 github stars and 35
github issues, all of the above work forms a less than 50MB tarball,
which contains 50 =el-get= packages, 1000 lines of emacs-lisp code, 4000
lines of documentation, hundreds of reference web links, just
[[https://s.yunio.com/xYpK_z][download]] and extract this tarball,
you'll get a tuned Emacs OS, and it works almost everywhere.

It's time for new year, and I hope you enjoy this gift. Any feedback
will be appreciated. Thanks!
